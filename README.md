## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Recommendation Engine
*   **Hybrid Algorithm:** Combines 70% Content-Based (genres, studios, authors) and 30% Collaborative Filtering (user similarity) for diverse and relevant results.
*   **Preferences System:** Customize your feed by selecting favorite genres, excluding dislikes, and setting minimum score thresholds.
*   **Smart Filtering:** Automatically excludes "Plan to Watch", "Dropped", and "Completed" entries to show you only fresh content.
*   **Similar User Matching:** Finds users with similar taste profiles (Jaccard similarity) to surface hidden gems.
